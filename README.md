3. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING (WHERE APPLICABLE)

Business Transfers

In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, dissolution, or other corporate transaction, your personal information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the acquiring entity adopts similar privacy protections.
Compliance with Law and Protection

We may disclose personal information to the extent required by law, court order, legal process, or regulation.
We may also do so if it is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Crisp Recording Studios, our employees, or others.
Co-Sponsors and Partners

If the Entune Sweepstakes is co-sponsored by or partnered with another entity, we will provide notice to you. Any information you submit for the co-sponsored Sweepstakes may be shared with that partner, who is solely responsible for its own data practices.
Additional Disclaimer
Except where required by law, Crisp Recording Studios disclaims liability for the acts or omissions of third parties with whom we share personal information. By using any third-party service or engaging with a co-sponsor, you assume any additional risks and are subject to that third party’s privacy policies.

Sweepstakes Duration: We maintain personal information to administer the Entune Sweepstakes, notify winners, and address any claims or disputes.
Legal Obligations: We may retain certain records to comply with tax, legal, or regulatory obligations.
Deletion or Anonymization: Once data is no longer needed, we securely delete, destroy, or anonymize it, consistent with applicable laws and operational limitations.
Additional Disclaimer
We disclaim liability for residual data that may remain on backup systems or that is required to be retained by law. We also disclaim liability for any claims arising from the timing or manner in which data is deleted or retained beyond our control.

6. COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
We use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to enhance user experiences and collect usage data. You can control cookies through your browser settings. However, disabling certain cookies may limit some features or functionality of our website or services.

Additional Disclaimer
Crisp Recording Studios disclaims liability for any issues or damages resulting from your decision to disable cookies, as well as for the data practices of third-party analytics or advertising networks that employ tracking technologies under their own policies.

7. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
If you reside outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. or other jurisdictions with data protection laws different from those in your country. We implement safeguards required by law for cross-border data transfers where applicable.

Additional Disclaimer
By providing your personal information, you acknowledge any associated risks with international transfers and waive any liability against us for the acts or omissions of foreign governmental or regulatory bodies, or for unlawful interceptions by third parties.

8. SECURITY MEASURES
We implement commercially reasonable security measures—encryption, access controls, secure servers, etc.—to protect your personal information. Despite these precautions, no system is entirely secure or error-free.

Additional Disclaimer
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim liability for any unauthorized or unlawful access to your information that is beyond our reasonable control, including hacking, phishing, or other security intrusions.

9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The Entune Sweepstakes is intended for individuals at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from minors. If you believe we may have inadvertently gathered information from a minor, please contact us, and we will promptly take appropriate action.

Additional Disclaimer
Crisp Recording Studios disclaims liability for any misrepresentations by users regarding their age. We will delete minors’ data upon discovery or verified parental request, consistent with applicable law.
